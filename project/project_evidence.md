### Give an example of pseudocode for a function

```

      reduce the number of available seats in the cinema

```

### Demonstrate testing in your program.

- Test code

  ``` ruby
  require("minitest/autorun")
  require ("minitest/reporters")
  Minitest::Reporters.use! Minitest::Reporters::SpecReporter.new

  require_relative("../models/display.rb")

  class TestCategory < MiniTest::Test

    def test_display_amount_gives_currency_string__10
      assert_equal('10.00', Display.amount(10))
    end

    def test_display_amount_gives_currency_string__1
      assert_equal('1.00', Display.amount(1))
    end

    def test_display_amount_gives_currency_string__10_10
      assert_equal('10.10', Display.amount(10.10))
    end

    def test_display_amount_gives_currency_string__237_05
      assert_equal('237.05', Display.amount(237.05))
    end

    def test_display_amount_returns_negative_numbers__10
      assert_equal('-10.00', Display.amount(-10))
    end

    def test_display_amount_returns_negative_numbers__237_05
      assert_equal('-237.05', Display.amount(-237.05))
    end

  end
  ```

- Code under test

  ```ruby
  class Display

    def self.amount(amount)
      money_array = amount.to_s.split(".")
      pounds = money_array[0]
      pence = money_array[1]
      if pence == nil
        pence = "00"
      end
      return "#{pounds}.#{pence}"
    end
  end
  ```

- Failing test

  ![](../screenshots/failing_test.png)

- Corrected code under test

  ```ruby
  class Display

    def self.amount(amount)
      money_array = amount.to_s.split(".")
      pounds = money_array[0]
      pence = money_array[1]
      if pence == nil
        pence = "00"
      end
      if pence.length < 2
        pence = pence + "0"
      end
      if pence.length > 2
        pence = pence.round
      end
      return "#{pounds}.#{pence}"
    end
  end
  ```

- Passing test

### Show an API being used within your program.
Take a screenshot of:

- The code that uses or implements the API
  ![](../screenshots/group_translate_api.png)

- The API being used by the program whilst running

### Group Project
[Project Readme](https://github.com/docljn/codeclan_group_project/blob/master/README.md)

#### Take a screenshot of the contributorâ€™s page on Github from your group project to show the team you worked with.
  ![](../screenshots/github_group_contrib.png)

#### Take a screenshot of the project brief from your group project.
