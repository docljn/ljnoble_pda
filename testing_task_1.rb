### Testing task 1 code:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Read through the code.
# Comment any errors you can see without correcting them.


def func1 val
  if val = 1
  return true
  else
  return false
  end
end
# best practice would have arguments in parentheses
# val = 1 is assigment, not testing equality
# indentation of the if-statement is unhelpful

dif max a b
  if a > b
      return a
  else
  b
  end
end
end
# dif is not def i.e. no function defined
# the arguments should be in parentheses and comma-separated
# indentation is unhelpful
# there is an additional 'end' which is unnecessary
# inconsistent use of explicit and implicit return

def looper
  for i in 1..10
  puts i
  end
end

# indentation unhelpful
# looper function is complete at this point




# the following code appears to be inter-related, but has not been defined as a function.
# this may or may not be deliberate

failures = 0

if looper == 10
  puts "looper passed"
else
  puts "looper failed"
  failures = failures + 1
# missing end
# looper will never return 10 as puts returns nil
# need to add explicit return of i after end of loop

if func1(3) == false
  puts "func1(3) passed"
else
  puts "func1(3) failed"
  failures = failures + 1
end


if max(100,1) == 100
  puts "max(100,1) passed"
else
  puts "func1(3) failed"
  failrues = failures + 1
end
# copy-paste appears to have been used at line 68
# refers to func1(3) instead of max(100,1)
# mis-spelling of failrues


if failures
  puts "Test Failed"
else
  puts "Test Passed"
end

# if failures WHAT?
# This will give Test Failed even if failures = 0 as set
# at start of test run.
# should be if failures > 0
